This is a Sudoku game solver program created using backtracking algorithm. I have built a GUI (Graphical User Interface) of this program using PyGame.

2. Click on the empty position to enter a digit
3. Press "enter" to check 
4. A red cross at the bottom left shows that the digit is inavlid. 
5. Keep trying until the GUI sets the digit into the board.
6. To get the solution, press "space" and watch al steps that the program takes to solve the game using backtracking.
